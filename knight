Given an 8*8 empty chessboard in which a knight is placed at a position (X, Y). Your task is to find the number of positions in the chessboard knight can jump into in a single move .
Note:- Rows and Columns are numbered through 1 to N.
Input
User Task:
Since this will be a functional problem, you don't have to take input. You just have to complete the function Knight() that take integers X and Y as arguments.

Constraints:-
1 <= X <= 8
1 <= Y <= 8
Output
Return the number of positions Knight can jump into in a single move.



#pyhton code for knight jump :

def Knight(X,Y):
    count=0
    for i in range(-2,3):
        if i == 0:
            continue
        for j in range(-2,3):
            if j==0 or abs(i) == abs(j):
                continue
            if 0<X+i<=8 and 0<Y+j<=8:
                count +=1
    return count
