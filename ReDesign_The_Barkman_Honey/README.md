ðŸ’«**Problem**
> Barkman Honey, is a foreign honey company. We choose it for improvement because we believe the current UI and UX design is outdated and not user-friendly.

ðŸ’«**Solution**
> Our goal is to enhance the UI and UX design to make it more modern and intuitive, so users can easily navigate and understand the website's purpose. To streamline the website, we plan to remove unnecessary pages such as the "Kitchen" section, as it is not relevant for customerâ€™s purchasing honey. We have presented new things that we have thought through our website.

ðŸ’«**Sections**
> On the first page, we have revamped the appearance to give it a modern touch, including a redesigned navbar. The next section is the product section, where users can easily find the names and descriptions of various honey products. Following that is the "Trace" section, which allows users to track the location of their honey and see how far it is from them. Another interesting section is "About Honey," where users can learn about the history of honey and the origin of this company, providing valuable information. We also have a section detailing how honey is made and how bees produce it, with interesting features to engage users. Additionally, we highlight our promises and values, which motivate us to produce better honey and reach more people.
