# sudo-solver

An open source application built using the new router, server components and everything new in Next.js 13.

> **Warning**
> This app is a work in progress. I'm building this in public. You can follow the progress on Twitter [@sudo-solver](https://twitter.com/sudo-solver).
> See the roadmap below.

## About this project

This project as an experiment to see how a modern app (with features like authentication, subscriptions, API routes, static pages for docs ...etc) would work in Next.js 13 and server components.

**This is not a starter template.**

A few people have asked me to turn this into a starter. I think we could do that once the new features are out of beta.

## Note on Performance

> **Warning**
> This app is using the unstable releases for Next.js 13 and React 18. The new router and app dir is still in beta and not production-ready.
> **Expect some performance hits when testing the dashboard**.
> If you see something broken, you can ping me [@sudo-solver](https://twitter.com/sudo-solver).

## Known Issues

A list of things not working right now:

1. ~GitHub authentication (use email)~
2. ~[Prisma: Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/var/task/.next/server/chunks/schema.prisma'](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/16117)~
3. ~[Next.js 13: Client side navigation does not update head](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/42414)~
4. [Cannot use opengraph-image.tsx inside catch-all routes](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/48162)

## Why not tRPC, Turborepo or X?

I might add this later. For now, I want to see how far we can get using Next.js only.

If you have some suggestions, feel free to create an issue.
