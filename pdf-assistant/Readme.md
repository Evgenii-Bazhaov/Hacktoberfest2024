# PDF Question Assistant

This project implements a Python-based virtual assistant that can answer your questions about a uploaded PDF document. It leverages Google's PaLM API for powerful natural language processing.

## Features

* Upload PDF documents
* Ask questions about the PDF content
* Receive answers generated by the PaLM API based on the document's text
* Optional text-to-speech functionality for voice interaction

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* PyMuPDF library (`pip install fitz`)
* Google Generative AI library (`pip install google-generativeai`)
* dotenv library (`pip install python-dotenv`)
* Speech Recognition library (optional, for voice input - `pip install SpeechRecognition`)
* PyText3 library (optional, for text-to-speech - `pip install pyttsx3`)
* tkinter library (optional, for GUI - included in most Python installations)
* A Google Cloud project with access to the PaLM API (refer to Google's documentation)

## Usage

1. **Create a `.env` file** in the project directory. Add the line `API=<your_palm_api_key>` where `<your_palm_api_key>` is your Google Cloud API key for PaLM access.
2. **Run the script**: Open a terminal in the project directory and run `python main.py`.
3. **Upload a PDF**: The script will prompt you to select a PDF document using a file dialog.
4. **Start conversation (optional)**: The script will ask if you want to use voice interaction.
5. **Ask questions**: Type your questions about the uploaded PDF in the console or speak them if using voice input. The assistant will answer based on the document's content.

## Additional Notes

* The GUI functionalities are currently commented out in the code. Uncomment the relevant sections in `main.py` if you want to develop a graphical user interface.
* Text-to-speech and voice input functionalities are optional and require additional libraries.

This is a foundational project, and you can customize it further by adding features like:

* User-friendly GUI elements
* Support for different file formats
* Advanced question parsing and answering techniques

I hope this README provides a clear understanding of the project!
