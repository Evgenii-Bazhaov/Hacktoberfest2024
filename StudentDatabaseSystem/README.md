# Student Database Management System

## About the Project

The Student Database Management System is a comprehensive solution designed to efficiently manage student information using SQLite3. This project simplifies the task of storing, retrieving, and manipulating student records, offering a user-friendly interface for administrators or educators. Developed with SQLite3, Python, and various libraries, this system ensures reliability and ease of use in managing student data.

## Purpose

The purpose of the Student Database Management System project is to provide a practical learning experience in database management, Python programming, and the utilization of various libraries. By building this system, users gain hands-on experience in effectively managing student data, understanding SQLite3 database operations, and implementing user-friendly interfaces using libraries such as questionary, matplotlib, pandas, and rich. This project serves as a valuable educational tool for students to deepen their understanding of database management systems and enhance their programming skills.

This project was undertaken as a school project to apply theoretical knowledge into practical implementation, emphasizing the importance of database management in educational settings and providing a platform for educators and administrators to efficiently manage student records.
